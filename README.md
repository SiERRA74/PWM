# Password Vault

Password Vault is a secure and user-friendly password manager built with Python and Tkinter. It hashes your account password using bcrypt and uses the unhashed password as a Vigenere cipher key for encrypting and decrypting other passwords associated with the account.

## Features:

Secure Login: Account passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
Vigenere Encryption: Encrypts and decrypts stored passwords with a user-provided master password.
Responsive GUI: Built with Tkinter for an interactive and intuitive user experience.
Password Management: Add, view, and delete passwords associated with unique aliases.
Theming Options: Easily toggle between light and dark modes (future feature).
